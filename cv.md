## Summary
I have been working as back-end developer in EPAM for several years but I have experience in front-end as well: some projects required implementation of tasks from back-end to UI. 
That's how I gained novice-level practical skills in CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. But these skills are not enough to be professional full-stack developer.  
So the goals of my participation in the course is to get new and structure existing knowledge, learn front-end best practices and become full-stack.
